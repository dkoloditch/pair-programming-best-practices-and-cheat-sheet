# Pair Programming Best Practices and Cheat Sheet

## A General Note

This document is not intended as a rigid prescription for pair programming.
The goal is to balance the natural and organic experience of pairing with
a few guidelines to assist and improve the efficiency of the process. Keep
this in mind as you improve your technique!

### Time Management

Start with a reasonably well-defined task.
- Knowing the overarching goal makes for more efficient use of time and
  prevents your team from getting sidetracked.

Break task into smaller goals.
- Agreeing on one small goal at a time to helps your team stay focused and
  avoid getting overwhelmed by the scope of the larger task.

### Relying On / Supporting Your Partner

When driving:
  - Focus on the smaller goal and ignore larger issues
  - Trust the observer to be your safety net
  - Say what you are about to do
  - Ask for implementation feedback

When observing:
  - Review code, don't dictate
  - Ask questions to assist the driver in thinking through issues
  - Be conscious of:
    - the current task
    - potential bugs
    - simplicity / clarity
    - design
  - Note errors and unreadable code
  - Bring up alternative implementations
  - Jot down larger issues and improvements, then present after task completion

### Syncing

There are times when pairing with your partner feels out of sync or unbalanced.
This is normal. Maintain awareness so you can recognize when this happens and
make a quick effort to sync up again. Pairing disruptions can lead to solo
work, which is counterproductive for several reasons.

Here are a few ways of re-syncing:
- Ask questions
- Switch roles
- Take a break

### Switching Roles

Be conscious of how much time you spend in your respective roles and make
a point to switch every so often. This helps both partners maintain
focus, as well as provides micro and macro level perspective on the work at
hand.

Unsure of when to rotate? Try the
[Pomodoro Technique](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/).

### Context

The experience of pairing varies based on the persons involved and
how they relate to each other. Things like communication, programming styles,
and personal connections will differ. Make note of these differences between
yourself and your partner to improve the overall experience and make
transitions smoother.

### Celebrate!

Take a moment to celebrate as you complete tasks and overcome problems. Pairing
is more effective with positive feedback and a connection with your counterpart.
