# Pairing - Best Practices and Cheat Sheet

### Start with a reasonably well-defined task

Should be completable within 1-2 hours

### Break task into smaller goals

Agree on one tiny goal at a time, something completable within a few minutes.

### Rely On Your Partner, Support Your Partner

When driving:
  - Focus on the smaller goal and ignore larger issues
  - Trust the observer to be your safety net
  - Say what you are about to do
  - Ask for implementation feedback

When observing:
  - Review code, don't dictate
  - Be conscious of:
    - the current task
    - potential bugs
    - simplicity / clarity
    - design
  - Note errors and unreadable code
  - Bring up alternative implementations
  - Jot down larger issues and improvements, then present after task completion

### Sync up frequently

There are times when communication with your partner is out of sync. This is
normal. When it happens, sync up again or take a break. Pairing disruptions can
lead to solo work, which is counterproductive.

### Switch Roles Often

Switch roles oftenâ€”at least every half hour. This keeps you both fully engaged,
u in tune with the low-level details and the big picture. Also, driving
full-blast can tire you out, and it's hard to maintain the vigilance required
of the observer role for longer than half an hour. Switching roles recharges
you.

### Celebrate

Take a moment to celebrate as you complete tasks and overcome problems. Pairing
is more effective with positive feedback and a connection with your counterpart.
